h3_ex3

For better visual, please view the pdf version

### Compiling:
In the `ex3/` directory, run 
```bash
make # build the program
make test # build the test
```
### Usage:
To use the program, run 
```bash
./h3_ex3 {order}_{dataType}.txt {new order}
# For example: ./h3_ex3 inc_int.txt rand
```
You can simply run `./p3_exe` to see a usage help.

To test the program, run
```bash
./h3_ex3_test
# This prints test content on the screen.
# Change the content of src/test.c for different datatype/dataset
```
#### Automated regression tests

A script is provided to test the program behavior using automated generated data. This script is  `testcase/test.sh`. To use this feature, please first build the program using instruction provided above, then invoke this script. The script will generate random test data and sort them using unix `sort` program. It will then compile the result against the output of the program using `diff`. 

Since there is no good way of automatically testing `rand` option. You will need to test this manually by running the program.

### Some footnotes:

The program is written in an *OOP* style. The `deque` structure mimics a container object. It is implemented using the linked list. The contained the datatype is `keyValuePair`. The design allows the `deque` to be used in a flexible way.
